# E-commerce-Platform-project

Our E-commerce Platform Project in Java is a simple yet robust online marketplace where users can browse through a catalog of products, add items to their cart, and securely complete transactions. Built using Java, the project focuses on core functionalities such as product listing, cart management, and checkout process. The backend is implemented using Java servlets for handling HTTP requests and responses, while JDBC is utilized for database connectivity.
